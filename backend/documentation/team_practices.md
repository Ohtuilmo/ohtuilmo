# Team Practices

## Atmosphere
* Members are respectful and supportive of each other.
* Members will be flexible and adjust to shifting circumstances.
* Members will be open and honest about their progress and challenges.

## Repository
* Repository documentation is written in English and Markdown and stored in the `documentation` directory.
* A member can be assigned to a maximum of two tasks at the same time.

## Attendance
* Members aim to work on-site when possible.
* When working remotely, members are present in a Zoom-call and Slack during the agreed working hours.
* Members participate in the daily scrum and retrospective meetings, or respond to the transcript in Slack within the same day.
    - If a member isn't working during the day, they notify the team in the daily-scrum channel on Slack.
* Demo member arrives by 8:30 for customer meetings to check the space and equipment.
    * Other members arrive by 8:50 or earlier.
* Members notify the team in advance through Slack's general channel if they are unable to attend or arrive late to a meeting.

## Version control
* Use "conventional commits" for commit messages [(link)](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
    - "[type](optional scope): [description]
    - e.g. "feat: display recorded hours to user on the front page"
    - common types:
        fix: patches a bug in the codebase
        feat: a new feature
        docs: changes to documentation
        refactor: code changes that are not visible to the user
* New features are developed in separate branches.
* Branches are merged to the main branch through pull requests. Anyone can merge a pull request after reviewing and approving it.
    - Any open PRs are assigned for review during daily scrums.
