# Team Practices

## Atmosphere
* Members are respectful and supportive of each other.
* Members will be flexible and adjust to shifting circumstances.
* Members will be open and honest about their progress and challenges.

## Repository
* Repository documentation is written in English and Markdown and stored in the `documentation` directory.
* A member can be assigned to a maximum of two tasks at the same time.

## Attendance
* Members aim to work on-site when possible.
* When working remotely, members are present in a Zoom-call and Slack during the agreed working hours.
* Members participate in the daily scrum and retrospective meetings, or respond to the transcript in Slack within the same day.
* Members notify the team in advance through Slack's general channel if they are unable to attend or arrive late to a meeting.

## Version control
* Merge conflict are handled through rebasing.
* New features are developed in separate branches.
* Branches are merged to the main branch through pull requests. Anyone can merge a pull request after reviewing and approving it.
