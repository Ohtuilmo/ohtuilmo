# Team Practices

## Repository
* Repository documentation is written in English and Markdown and stored in the `documentation` directory.

## Attendance
* Members aim to work on-site when possible.
* Members participate in the daily scrum and retrospective meetings, or respond to the transcript in Slack within the same day.
* Demo member arrives by 8:30 for customer meetings to check the space and equipment.
    * Other members arrive by 8:50 or earlier.
* Members notify the team in advance through Slack's general channel if they are unable to attend a meeting or arrive late.

## Version control
* Use "conventional commits" for commit messages [(link)](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
